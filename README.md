# Daily-Task
The best way to stay productive every day, and what people expect you to do is here, and finish it today! Focus on what you need to do today.  End today! It will keep you organized and use the list to help you visually check the progress of your work. A critical time notification will keep you on track and help you develop the habit of getting ahead of your usual routine.
